# Contact Form Setup Guide

## Current Status âœ…

Your contact form is now working! Here's what I've implemented:

### Development Mode (Current)
- âœ… Contact form accepts submissions
- âœ… Form data is logged to console
- âœ… Success/error messages display properly
- âœ… No external API dependencies required

### Production Setup (Optional)

To enable actual email sending, follow these steps:

## 1. Get a Resend API Key

1. Sign up at [Resend.com](https://resend.com/)
2. Go to your dashboard
3. Navigate to API Keys
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy the key

## 2. Update Environment Variables

Edit your `.env` file and replace the placeholder values:

```env
# Replace with your actual Resend API key
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_actual_api_key_here

# Update email addresses
FROM_EMAIL=your-verified-email@yourdomain.com
TO_EMAIL=your-contact-email@yourdomain.com
```

## 3. Verify Your Domain (Production Only)

For production use, you'll need to:
1. Verify your domain in Resend dashboard
2. Add required DNS records
3. Use a verified domain email for `FROM_EMAIL`

## 4. Test the Setup

1. Restart your development server
2. Submit a test message through the contact form
3. Check your email inbox

## Available Routes

- **Main Contact Form**: `/api/contact` - Handles form submissions
- **Test Route**: `/api/contact/test` - Development testing endpoint

## Development vs Production

### Development Mode
- Form submissions are logged to console
- No actual emails sent
- Perfect for testing and development

### Production Mode
- Actual emails sent via Resend
- Form data sent to your specified email
- Professional email delivery

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Failed to send email" error**
   - Check if RESEND_API_KEY is properly set
   - Verify the API key is valid
   - Ensure FROM_EMAIL is verified in Resend

2. **Form not submitting**
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify the development server is running
   - Check network tab for API call status

3. **Environment variables not loading**
   - Restart the development server after changing .env
   - Ensure .env file is in the root directory
   - Check for typos in variable names

## Current Configuration

Your contact form is currently configured for development mode and will:
- âœ… Accept form submissions
- âœ… Display success messages
- âœ… Log form data to console
- âœ… Work without external dependencies

The form is ready to use! ðŸŽ‰
